# URBAN-ET - modelling section

Steps to model ET with SCOPE:
1) download the SCOPE 2.0 from https://github.com/Christiaanvandertol/SCOPE
2) unzip in a the folder e.g. C:\Users\Youname\Documents\SCOPE-2.0
3) transfer to this folder the files: ROTH.m, TUCC.m, set_parameter_filenames_TUCC and set_parameter_filenames_ROTH (URBAN-ET/modelling/)
4) transfer to the folder ~\SCOPE-2.0\input the files: filenamesROTH, filenamesTUCC, input_data_TUCC, setoptionsROTH, setoptionsTUCC (URBAN-ET/modelling/)
5) transfer to the folder ~\SCOPE-2.0\input\dataset for_verification the files Input_ROTH and Input_TUCC with the input parameter (generated by URBAN-ET/data/SCOPE_parameters)
6) open Matlab and set the corrent folder to ~\SCOPE-2.0
7) write in the command window ROTH or TUCC and press enter

Note: the results will be save in the folder ~\SCOPE-2.0\input, and to read them in R and assess the results see URBAN-ET/results/readSCOPEresults
